Explanation of the Models
  Station - Where the bikes can originate and end
  Trip - the dates, times, station, and rider info
  Rider - the person renting the bike
Requirements
  Create a restful API that returns the following data:
    Return the information for one station given a station id
    Given one or more stations, return the number of riders in the following age groups, [0-20,21-30,31-40,41-50,51+, unknown], who ended their trip at that station for a given day.
    Given one or more stations, return the last 20 trips that ended at each station for a single day.
  Require every API request to include an API token and handle the case where this is missing.
  Add a test for at least one of the api calls.
  Use whatever go modules you like but don’t install 3rd party databases, caching server, or other server apps. For example, don’t use mysql, mariadb, postgres, redis, mongodb, memcached, etc.
  Setup your app so it can be run locally.
